# AI Hydroponics Project

This repository documents machine learning experiments on hydroponic plant growth using numeric features such as pH, plant age, and related metrics. While a rich image dataset from actual hydroponics experiments is linked for documentation and future use, **the current analysis relies on tabular (numeric) data only**.

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict and analyze plant growth in hydroponic systems using AI/ML models.
- **Data:** Numeric measurements (pH, plant age, etc.) collected from hands-on hydroponics experiments.
- **Code:** Notebooks for Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression modeling.
- **Images:** Full experimental image datasets are provided separately as proof of experiment and for future computer vision applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Access & Structure

**Numeric Data:**  
- Used directly in modeling (in CSV or similar tabular format).
- Features include: plant age, pH measurements, growth rates, etc.

**Images (Documentation/Proof Only):**  
- Large, nested image datasets grouped by days/stages (not used in current code).
- Hosted externally due to size limits and for transparency of real-world work.

**Access all original datasets here:**
