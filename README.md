AI Hydroponics

- **Project:** Applies machine learning to images of hydroponic plant growth to predict and analyze plant development.
- **Data:** Large, nested image datasets (grouped by day/stage) hosted on Google Drive, not in the repo itself.
- **Access:**  
  - [Download dataset from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1xqz33deKlVVbhDw3LeHWIKxfVsRQU8C4)  
  - Keep folder organization after downloading for code to work.
- **Code:**  
  - Jupyter/Colab notebooks for Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.
  - Located in `/Linear Regression/` and `/RandomForestRegressor/` folders.
- **How to use:**  
  - Clone the repo.
  - Download and extract the dataset.
  - Run analysis notebooks for predictions and model evaluation.

**Summary:**  
All code is here; all large images are external. Download the dataset, follow the workflow in the notebooks, and you can predict/visualize hydroponic plant growth using AI models.
